# Circles Protocol

Circles is a decentralized protocol for creating and distributing fair and social money through personal currencies. Built on the Gnosis Chain, it utilizes smart contracts to manage the creation, distribution, and transfer of personal currencies using the ERC1155 multi-token standard.

## Key Concepts

- **Personal Currencies**: Each individual can mint their own currency at a rate of one Circle per hour.
- **Trust Networks**: Currencies become valuable and transferable through trust relationships between participants.
- **Demurrage**: A 7% annual cost applied to held currencies, encouraging circulation and maintaining equity.

## Features

- Retroactive minting for up to 14 days
- Path-based transactions through trust connections
- Flexible economic interactions between individuals, organizations, and groups
- Equilibrium mechanism balancing issuance and demurrage
