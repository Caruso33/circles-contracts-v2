# Trust graph and flow graph

## Introduction

Path fungibility is achieved through people confirming trust in the authenticity of accounts of people they believe are authentic, and non-sybil.
By trusting the avatar of another person, you express that your tokens are equivalent and fungible for theirs. In this document we want to outline the definitions and corollaries for transitive path fungibility.

## Objective
